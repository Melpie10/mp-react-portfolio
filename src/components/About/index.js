          Former teacher in need of a career change. Having a little too much fun building things on the internet. 
          With a baby on the way, I want to create an app that will be my future baby.
          I started the Coding Bootcamp at University of North Carolina at Charlotte in October of 2021. 
          Since then, I have completed projects that include usage of: 
          * HTML
          * Advanced CSS
          * JavaScript
          * Web, server, and third party APIs
          * Node JS
          * Object-Oriented Programming
          * Express.JS
          * SQL
          * Object-Relational Mapping
          * Model-View controller
          * NoSQL
          * Progressive Web Applications
          * React
          * Github and Gitlab 

         I have worked in collaborative projects, such as the Baby Shower Games Application that will be released to the public soon.
